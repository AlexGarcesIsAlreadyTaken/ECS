# ECS - A CS Student Approach :)

The implementation is based on Austin Morlan's ECS [blog](https://austinmorlan.com/posts/entity_component_system/). However I did some minor changes (currently):
- Data Structures
- System implementations

Task List:

- [x] Entity Manager
- [x] Component Pool
- [x] Component Manager
- [ ] System/Logic Handler
- [x] Coordinator (as class Ecs)
- [x] Entity Handler [Nomad approach](https://medium.com/@savas/nomad-game-engine-part-4-2-adding-handles-8d299d80c7d0)
- [ ] Events

Compilation (Not recommended for now):
```
    make -j10
```
